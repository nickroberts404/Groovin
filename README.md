## Groovin

A circular 8-part drum machine that outputs MIDI. Inspired heavily by the iOS app "Patterning", I created Groovin to test my [@react-midi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-midi/hooks) packages as well as to expand on the capabilities of "Patterning". 

I'm very excited about this project and am constantly developing new features for it, with melodic tracks and sequence saving coming soon!
